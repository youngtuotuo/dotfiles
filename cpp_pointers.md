Pointers    - variables that store address of another variable

### Basic Syntax

    int x;  - declare a variable x to be an integer
              x has its own address in memory
    int *p; - p is a pointer, a pointer to an integer
              p has its own address in memory
    p = &x; - assign x's address to p's value
